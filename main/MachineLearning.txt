                                    Machine Learning Techniques for Stock Prediction

To create a system that predicts stock prices, the following machine learning techniques can be implemented in Python: 

1. Linear Regression

    Based on previous data, linear regression is a fundamental machine learning technique that can be used to predict future
    stock price values. This method establishes a linear relationship between the stock price and its characteristics, including
    volume, price-to-earnings ratio, etc. We can train a Multiple Linear Regression model and alter or drop parameters to obtain
    a linear relationship. Typically, the more data we have from the past, the more accurately our model predicts prices.

2. Support Vector Regression Machine
    
    It is based on a mathematical concept of hyperplanes. Instead of developing a model using response-predictor relationship,
    it tries to create a hyperplane between predicted and actual values. However, it involved a lot of steps beginning from data
    processing (normalization, etc.). Then, we train the data on a training dataset to get a hyperplane. Finally, we test the
    model using a validation dataset and compute the accuracy using the Mean Squared Error.

3. Neural Networks

    Various kinds of neural networks can be used to predict stock prices. We can focus on Long Short-Term Memory which is a
    recurring neural network. It extracts the relationship between actual and predicted prices and trains on a testing dataset
    while exploiting temporal dependencies and minimizing the error. However, it is a very advanced technique and unlikely to be
    used for this project.

4. Random Forest

    Random Forest is a Statistical technique which uses a forest of decision trees (a large number of decision trees) and 
    combines their prediction to yield a more accurate prediction. It can be very useful when there are a large number of
    features. Each tree trains on a subset of these input features, and combining the result of all trees helps avoid overfitting
    and improves the accuracy of the predictions.


Conclusion

    Considering that we have less experience with Machine Learning techniques and our data does not have a large number of
    features, we should probably not pursue Neural Networks and Random Forest. Between Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) and
    Support Vector Regression, Support Vector Regression has had more promising results in the past. However, MLR is simpler
    learn and implement and it would be wise to first implement MLR to gain insight. Based on the accuracy of results from MLR,
    we can shift or not to Support Vector Regression.
