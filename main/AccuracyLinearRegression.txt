                    Ways to improve accuracy of Linear Regression Model

1. Increase training dataset
    Acquiring a larger dataset is consistently beneficial as it enables the data to speak for itself, rather than
    depending solely on assumptions and unreliable correlations. The availability of abundant data leads to the development
    of superior and more precise machine learning models.

2. Remove missing/null values and outliers
    The unwelcome occurrence of missing or outlier values in the training data can significantly diminish the accuracy of
    a trained model and result in a biased outcome. This is due to the improper analysis of their behavior and relationship
    with other variables. Therefore, it is crucial to effectively address and handle missing and outlier values to ensure
    accurate predictions in machine learning models.

3. Feature Engineering
    Feature engineering is a critical step in machine learning that involves manipulating the input features to improve the
    accuracy of a linear model. Techniques such as feature selection, where irrelevant or redundant features are removed, can
    help in simplifying the model and reducing noise. Feature transformation, such as scaling or normalization, can ensure
    that features are on similar scales, preventing some features from dominating others during model training. Feature
    encoding, such as one-hot encoding or label encoding, can convert categorical variables into numerical representations
    that can be easily understood by the linear model.

4. Feature Selection
    Feature selection is a key technique in machine learning that involves carefully choosing a subset of relevant features
    from the original set of input features to improve the accuracy of a linear model. This process helps in simplifying the
    model, reducing noise, and mitigating the risk of overfitting.

5. Algorithmic Tuning
    Algorithmic tuning, also known as hyperparameter tuning, is the process of optimizing the hyperparameters of a machine
    learning algorithm to achieve the best possible performance. Hyperparameters are parameters that cannot be learned from
    the training data and need to be set by the user, such as learning rate, regularization strength, or number of hidden
    layers in a neural network. Tuning involves systematically adjusting these hyperparameters and training the model multiple
    times with different values to find the optimal combination that yields the highest accuracy or other desired performance
    metrics.
