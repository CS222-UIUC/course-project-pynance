# course-project-pynance

**Introduction**

Project Name - Pynance 

Investors, traders, and other people interested in the stock market need to look up the data for a particular stock in the United States. With Pynance, users can look up information, visualize stock data, and predict the future stock price for a company before making any investments.

Functionality

Users will receive a description of the company when looking up a stock.
Users can see the most recent record of a company’s stock
Users have access to a visualization of the trends of stock prices
Users will be able to see predictions for future stock prices
Proper GUI through either terminal and website for prediction and visualization.

Alternatives and Precedents

There exist few financial visualization applications and services that implement statistical frameworks that allow for prediction on previously seen data. Our take on the project was to build and test such models so as to provide this missing prediction component, and to build a refined visualization and an interface on the side so as to provide a tangible evidence of its accuracy.
